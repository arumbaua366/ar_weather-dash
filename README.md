## About

## Features
* A modern, moody, minimalist layout.
* Displays details such as the current temperature as well as what it "feels like" instead of that temperature. This takes into consideration factors such as wind chill and humidity.
* Displays the high and low temperatures of the day.
* Displays wind speed.
* Displays a five-day forecast of that city which includes the current temperature, "feels like" temperature, and humidity.
* Finally, the app displays previously searched cities. If clicked, the app will re-display the city's weather details.
